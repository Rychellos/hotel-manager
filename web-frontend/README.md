# SolidStart

Everything you need to build a Solid project, powered by [`solid-start`](https://start.solidjs.com);

## Creating a project

## Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open

# or start server and allow other devices on the network access dev server

npm run dev --host
```

## Building

```bash
npm run build
```

## This project was created with the [Solid CLI](https://github.com/solidjs-community/solid-cli)
